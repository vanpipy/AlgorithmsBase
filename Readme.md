# How to make a basic test rule?
1.Program running successfully.

2.The input of program is empty without exception.

3.The edge of program's input.

The points 1 & 2 are required and easy to test.

Point 3 is funny to explore, but something easy to find is still obvious. For example, like making 100 or 1000 inputs to test or even more. The importance of edge input is variety and needs time to find it but it's still funny like the beginning of this pragraph said.
