# How to make a basic test rule?
1.Program running successfully.

2.The input of program is empty without exception.

3.The edge of program's input.

The point 1, 2 is required and easy to test.

Point 3 is funny to explore, but something easy to find is still obviously. Example like making 100 or 1000 inputs to test or even more. The important of edge input is variety and need time to find it but it still funny like the beginning of this pragraph said.
